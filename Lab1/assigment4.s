#1.	Register $v0 is the register that has the system call
#coded loaded into it when syscall is run. Based on that
#value in $v0, the operating system runs a specific operation.
#Register $v0 holds the value that is returned when a function
#is returned a value. Otherwise, if a function does not
#return a value, the register $v0 does not hold a value.
